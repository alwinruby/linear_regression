# Linear Regression


Linear regression is a basic predictive analytics technique that uses historical data to predict an output variable. It is popular for predictive modelling because it is easily understood and can be explained using plain English.

The basic idea is that if we can fit a linear regression model to observed data, we can then use the model to predict any future values.

There are two kinds of variables in a linear regression model:

  The input or predictor variable is the variable(s) that help predict the value of the output variable. It is commonly referred to as X.

  The output variable is the variable that we want to predict. It is commonly referred to as Y.

To estimate Y using linear regression, we assume the equation:

      Yₑ = α + β X

where Yₑ is the estimated or predicted value of Y based on our linear equation.

Our goal is to find statistically significant values of the parameters α and β that minimise the difference between Y and Yₑ.

If we are able to determine the optimum values of these two parameters, then we will have the line of best fit that we can use to predict the values of Y, given the value of X.
